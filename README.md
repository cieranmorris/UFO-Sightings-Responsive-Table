# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

### Accomplished: Automatic Table and Data Search using Multiple Search Categories

* Primary coding languages used within this repository: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I successfully wrote code that dynamically appends a table to the web page, which automatically updates with new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Columns included in the table contain data relating to `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` per UFO sighting.

* Utilizing a date form in my HTML document, I effeciently wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.


* Additionally, with the application of multiple `input` tags within the form function, I generated JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
